#24 Things Before Christmas

Inspired by many "24-this, 24-that" ([24 pull-requests](http://24pullrequests.com), [24 ways](https://24ways.org)) I decided to do my own 24 days before Christmas and do a micro-project in each day. 

I have a plan, to laid-out a few ideas for each day, without much more than that; then I will spend part of my free time (usually between 6pm and 11pm) to create something that fits the idea on that day. 

The time is VERY limited, I'm not developing during the day - work constraints, obviously - but it would be a nice micro-challenge and hopefuly I can showcase a few things I'm interested or learned through the year.

##Few ideas

Considering the limited time to actually 'do' something, I decided to pencil down a few ideas so I can have a direction on the days to come.

- I thought about icons of things (Christmassy or not) that I always wanted to do and never got around to do it.
- Also some Christmas artwork, like cards or e-cards.
- Then I thought would be nice to have a 'brainstorm' session with my own daughter, and try to get 24 toy ideas that she would like to get on Christmas. Although this could back-fire and I might create expectations for all these toys, I think would be fun exercise.
- Also thought about linking this project with other ones I want to do, but might be way tooo confusing.

To make nice to *see* all the development I've been committing to the gh-pages branch, and you can see the days as they come along...

##Days

Click away and have fun!
