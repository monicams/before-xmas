#Day 3

*Three.js experiment*

I'm exploring a few things, and on this day I just did a three.js cube following the tutorial. I expected to be simpler, but found out that takes more knowledge to play with other parameters, maybe I need a more 'basic' tutorial for manipulation and understanding how to apply everything to an object and/or scene.
