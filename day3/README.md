#Day 3

*Three.js experiment*

I'm exploring a few things, 3D included, and for Day 3 I explored *Three.js* making a simple cube following the tutorial. The begining is simple, but takes more knowledge to play with other parameters, objects and effects, maybe I need a more 'basic' tutorial for manipulation and understanding how to apply everything to an object and/or scene.

Learn more about [Three.js](http://threejs.org/).
