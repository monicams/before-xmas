#Day 4

*Two.js*

"Two.js is a two-dimentional drawing api geared towards modern web browsers". And it seemed simple to test and use, so for *Day 4* I wanted to explore some simple line drawing with two.js. Lesson learned: last item drawed is the first one showing on the layering... so you might need to rearrange your code to reflect that (since I didn't find a z-index setter).
