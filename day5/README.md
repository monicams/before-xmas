#Day 5

*SVG*

For *Day 5* just wanted to work and optimise a few *SVG* paths, and then manipulate some style/colours. Optimized SVG using the [SVGOMG tool](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) and the beautiful winter vectors are from [Inna Moreva](https://creativemarket.com/InnaMoreva/418475-24-vector-linear-Winter-Time-icons)
